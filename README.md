# Let's start to learn python by playing games
## 1. Basic theory
1. In this project I try to explain the basic project on python, which is creating a number guessing game. </br>
2. Here I use random2 ,which is the latest version of random, a python library used to geanarate a random number in between the given range. </br>
3. Then, I ask the computer to select a number by using random.</br>
4. After that, I try to guess the number...

## 2. About the Steps
I complete the project in different steps: </br>
Step_1>> Step_2>> Step_3>> Final_game </br></br>
<b> Step_1:</b> </br>
In step_1 I try to make a simple game, where I initillize the random2 library, and select a number, if it is correct, we got the result "you win" & if it is wrong, we got a result "you lose, the number is <b>{comp_num}</b>". </br>
<b> Step_2:</b> </br>
In Step_2 I make the game little harder by introducing <b>Chances</b>, Here you are able to try guess the number for a limited period of time (for the game the you have only 3 chances). You have to guess the number inbetween those chances. Else you lose the game.</br>
<b> Step_3:</b> </br>
Let me, introduce you the different round of this, game. there are 5 different round, and in each round the chance is reduced by half.</br>
<b> Final Game:</b> </br>
This is the momment, we all ar witting for, Where I introduced the last saction, which is the range. </br>
In first round, computer can take any number between 0 to 100, and we have 50 chances.</br>
In second round, range become 1 to 80, whereas the chances ar reduced to half.</br>
In third round, range and chances become 60 and 12 respectively.</br>
In fourth round, range and chances become 40 and 6 respectively.</br>
To make it more complicated, In the final round, the range become 20 whereas you have only 3 chance.
